                <p>Hi there. My name is Saad. If you are reading this, that means you have somehow ended up in this
                    little project of mine. I am doing this as a part of the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design
                    Certification program. This is the last project, and after successful completion, I should be
                    certified. Keeping my fingers crossed!</p>

            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>After more than a decade of delay, I started following my passion since July 2022. I like new ideas and
                perspectives, progress, creativity, contribution, and creation. I also like Sci-fi, Tech, Computers,
                A.I., and Robotics.</p>
            <p>More than using my body, I like using my brain. I like thought experiments and creative problem solving.
                I like to use the power of imagination to come up with different solutions.</p>
            <p>Overall, I like contribution more than consumption. And I believe Computer Programming gives me the opportunity to do exactly that!</p>
            <h2 class="full-width-background">I am working to become a Front-End Web Developer. Currently, I am learning and working with HTML and CSS. Next is vanilla JavaScript, React.js, and Node.js. </h2>
